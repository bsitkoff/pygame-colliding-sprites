## Try It Out

Hit **Run** in the terminal to start `collide.py`.

Move the player into the alien. Watch the terminal output.

**Notice:**
- What happens when you collide?
- Does the alien move on its own?
- Look at the code — find where `colliderect` is called. What does the code do when it detects a hit?

> *[TODO: insert free-text-auto assessment — "What did you observe when the sprites collided? How does the code respond to the collision?"]*

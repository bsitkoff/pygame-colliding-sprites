### 🖼️ Using Your Own Sprite

*Need a custom image? Here's the workflow — or rewatch the video from Lesson 1.*

1. Find an image that's **at least 80×80 pixels**
2. Open **[Squoosh](https://squoosh.app)**, resize to about 80×80, and download *(Squoosh can make images smaller but not larger — start with a big enough image!)*
3. Upload the file to your `images/` folder in Codio
4. Update the `Actor('name')` in your code to match the filename (no `.png`)

### Requirements

Build a game in `tryit.py` that:

1. Has a **player** that moves with the keyboard
2. Has **at least one enemy** that moves toward the player
3. Has **at least one collectible** that moves to a new random position when collected
4. **Responds to collisions** — something happens when sprites overlap
5. Uses **your own sprites**

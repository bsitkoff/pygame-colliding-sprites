## Playtest and Reflect

Swap with a neighbor and play each other's games.

**Give feedback on:**
- Is it clear what you're supposed to do?
- Does the collision feel right — fair? Too easy? Too hard?
- What would make it more satisfying?

---

**Reflect on your own work:**

What was the trickiest part of getting `colliderect()` to work the way you wanted?
